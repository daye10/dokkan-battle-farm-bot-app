'''
Note: Since ver.5.0.0 and safetynet implementation in the JP Version, there is no way to create a JP account from the bot !!
So the bot only works with GLB version, even if options for the JP version are displayed, it will return to the GLB version.

This is a pre-release version, the bot will work but is not optinal, there are still several things to add/modify/delete,
if you have a comment, do not hesitate to let me know! 

(Read README.md for more info)
