[![N|Solid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Dragon_Ball_Z_Dokkan_Battle_logo.png)](https://dbz-dokkan.bngames.net/en/)

This bot allow players to easily complete every events, but also includes many features such as summoning, transfer account from facebook, farm, and many others features!

This bot is an improved version of the [open source bot](https://github.com/RobertRautenbach/Open-Source-Battle-Bot), I updated it and added some extra features.
> Note: Since ver.5.0.0 and safetynet implementation on the JP Version, there is no way to create a JP account from the bot.
> So it only works with GLB version, even if options for the JP version are displayed, it will return to the GLB version.

```diff
- ðŸ”´ Facebook Link issue :
Once you have clicked on "Continue" close the browser window, link to your facebook account will process as well !!
- ðŸ”´ Z Battle issue :
Since version Z, you have to finish all missions of the "The Greatest Warrior" panel (missions for beginners to unlock f2p LR goku) to unlock this mode ingame, working on it.
